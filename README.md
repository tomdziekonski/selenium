## General info
OpenHRProject is my Selenium sandbox project which I use for learning front end automation. The code is written in Java, following the Page Object Model concept. There is a Base class
which prepares the WebDriver and all necessary objects. Each page of the application has its own corresponding class which stores Web Elements.
Thank you for visiting.
